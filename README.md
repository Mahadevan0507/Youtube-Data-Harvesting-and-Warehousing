# Youtube-Data-Harvesting-and-Warehousing
The project titled "YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing" aims to provide users with a platform to access and analyze data from various YouTube channels. It utilizes a combination of SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit to develop an intuitive application for retrieving, storing, and querying YouTube channel and video data.

Tools and libraries employed in this project include:

- **Streamlit**: Used to create a user-friendly interface enabling users to interact with the application seamlessly.
  
- **Python**: Chosen as the primary programming language for its versatility and extensive library support, facilitating tasks such as data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualization.
  
- **Google API Client**: Utilized to communicate with YouTube's Data API v3, allowing retrieval of essential information such as channel details, video specifics, and comments.
  
- **MongoDB**: Employed as a document database for storing data in a flexible and scalable manner, serving as the initial storage or "data lake."
  
- **PostgreSQL**: Selected for its reliability and advanced features, facilitating the migration of data from the data lake to a SQL database for efficient querying and analysis.

When engaging in YouTube data scraping, ethical considerations are paramount. Adherence to YouTube's terms and conditions, obtaining appropriate authorization, and compliance with data protection regulations are fundamental. Responsible handling of collected data, ensuring privacy, confidentiality, and preventing misuse, is essential. Moreover, considering the potential impact on the platform and its community is crucial for maintaining integrity throughout the scraping process.

The application offers various features, including the retrieval of channel and video data from YouTube, storage in MongoDB, migration to PostgreSQL for efficient querying, and search and retrieval options from the SQL database. These functionalities are designed to provide users with comprehensive access to YouTube data while upholding ethical standards.
